## v0.1 — Boots, schema in place, no logic yet (2026-05-09)

**What changed:**
- Repo scaffolded: `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `pyproject.toml`, `.env.example`.
- Two-container compose: `db` (`pgvector/pgvector:pg16`) + `app` (FastAPI on port 8080).
- Postgres schema (`migrations/001_init.sql`) with three tables: `turns`, `messages`, `memories`.
  - `vector(1024)` column + HNSW index for ANN search.
  - `tsvector` GENERATED columns for BM25-style FTS.
  - `memories.supersedes` self-FK ready for fact-evolution chains.
- FastAPI lifespan manages asyncpg pool; `GET /health` pings DB and reports degraded LLM/embed/rerank flags if API keys missing.
- `pgdata` named volume → data survives `docker compose down`.

**Why:**
- Get the deploy story working *first* so each subsequent iteration is verified end-to-end via the eval harness's exact entrypoint (`docker compose up -d` + curl `/health`).
- Schema with both vector + tsvector columns chosen upfront so we don't need a migration when we add hybrid retrieval at Step 4.

**Result:**
- `docker compose up -d` boots cleanly. `curl localhost:8080/health` → `{"status":"ok","version":"0.1.0","degraded":["llm","embed","rerank"]}` until env keys provided.
- Restart-survival of DB schema confirmed: `docker compose down && up -d` keeps tables.
- No business logic yet; recall/extraction stubs come next.

**Next:**
- Step 1: implement `POST /turns` raw-store path + `DELETE /sessions/{id}` + `DELETE /users/{id}`. No extraction yet — just persistence.

---

## v0.2 — Raw turn storage + DELETE endpoints + global error handlers (2026-05-09)

**What changed:**
- Pydantic schemas for the full §3 contract in `schemas.py` (TurnIn/Out, RecallIn/Out, SearchIn/Out, MemoryOut, etc.).
- `repository.py` — async CRUD over asyncpg: `insert_turn` (atomic turn + messages in one transaction), `delete_session`, `delete_user`, `list_user_memories`.
- Routes: `POST /turns`, `DELETE /sessions/{id}`, `DELETE /users/{id}`, `GET /users/{user_id}/memories`. Stubs for `/recall` and `/search` (return empty — wired in Steps 2-5).
- Optional bearer auth dependency: gated by `MEMORY_AUTH_TOKEN` env. If unset, `Authorization` header ignored.
- Global FastAPI handlers: `RequestValidationError → 422` with structured detail; unhandled `Exception → 500` (no traceback leak). Per TASK.md §5 "service must not crash on malformed input".

**Why:**
- Persistence-first: data must be in Postgres before any business logic runs against it. Eval harness does `POST /turns` → `GET /memories`/`POST /recall` and expects synchronous correctness — we land that contract first, then layer extraction/recall.
- Stub `/recall` + `/search` so the eval harness gets 200s with valid JSON shape from day one (no crashes on cold sessions per §3).
- Auth-as-dependency keeps the gate centralized — flipping `MEMORY_AUTH_TOKEN` toggles all routes at once.

**Result:**
- Smoke test: `POST /turns` → 201 + UUID; row visible in `turns` + `messages` tables.
- `DELETE /sessions/{id}` → 204; only target session removed (other session for same user untouched).
- `DELETE /users/{id}` → 204; cascade removes turns + messages; `count(*) = 0` after.
- Malformed JSON body → 422 with `{"error":"validation_error","detail":[...]}` instead of stacktrace.
- Missing required fields (no `session_id`, empty `messages`, no `timestamp`) → 422 with all three reported.
- `/users/user-1/memories` → `{"memories":[]}` (correct: extraction not yet wired).

**Next:**
- Step 2: turn raw messages into embedded vectors (no LLM extraction yet) and stand up naive embedding-only `/recall` and `/search` to establish a recall@5 baseline against the fixture.

---

## v0.3 — Naive embedding recall, fixture-based eval, baseline established (2026-05-09)

**What changed:**
- `clients/embeddings.py`: Alem `text-1024` (dim=1024) wrapper with tenacity retry + http2.
- Migration `002_messages_embedding.sql`: adds `messages.embedding vector(1024)` + HNSW idx.
- `migrate.py`: idempotently re-applies migrations on every container boot (Postgres `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` only runs on a fresh data dir, so this complements it).
- `services/ingest.py`: `POST /turns` now embeds every message and stores the vector synchronously before returning 201. Per TASK.md §5 *"after /turns returns, ingested data must be immediately available"*.
- `services/recall.py`: `/recall` and `/search` do `embed(query) → cosine top-k` against `messages`.
- 5 fixture conversations (`conv_career`, `conv_pets`, `conv_preferences`, `conv_multihop`, `conv_noise`) + 12 probes in `probes.yaml` with `must_contain` / `must_be_empty` / `is_multi_hop` flags.
- `tests/test_recall_quality.py`: ingests every fixture, runs every probe, prints recall@5 with category breakdowns.
- `tests/test_contract.py`: 7 contract tests covering roundtrip / cold session / malformed JSON / missing fields / unicode / concurrent-session isolation.

**Why:**
- Embedding the **raw** message (not yet structured memory) lets us measure how far a vanilla setup goes before LLM extraction is added — that's the comparison point for Step 3.
- Naming the v0.3 *baseline* is critical: every later step is now a delta against numbers we wrote down, not vibes.
- HNSW index on a 1024-dim column needs to exist from day 1 — adding it later forces a reindex over the whole corpus.

**Result:**
- **recall@5 = 9/12 = 75%** overall on the fixture.
  - Multi-hop: 2/2 = 100% — surprising! With a small fixture, naive cosine pulls in both relevant turns. This will degrade with larger corpora; treating it as “solved” at this stage would be a mistake.
  - Noise resistance: 0/2 = 0% — vanilla cosine top-k *always* returns its k best, even when none are relevant. **This is the cleanest gap in v0.3 to fix.**
- 7/7 contract tests green: roundtrip, cold session, malformed JSON, missing fields, unicode, concurrent-session isolation.
- Failed probes:
  - `career_role`: needs canonical role normalization ("product management" ≠ "product manager") — Step 3 LLM extraction territory.
  - `noise_color`, `noise_food`: see noise resistance above.
- p95 ingest latency: ~150ms / message embedded (sequential httpx calls; can parallelize in Step 3 batch).
- p95 recall latency: ~110ms (single embed + 1 SQL query).

**Next:**
- Step 3: LLM extraction. Replace "embed every raw message" with "extract structured facts → embed those". This should both improve precision (canonical `key=role,value=Product Manager` beats free-text matching) and start populating `/users/{id}/memories` with structured records, which is the single biggest visible quality differentiator on the human review.

---

## v0.4 — LLM extraction pipeline (Alem `alemllm`) (2026-05-09)

**What changed:**
- `clients/llm.py`: Alem chat-completions wrapper with tenacity retry + http2.
- `util/json_parse.py`: lenient parser — handles ` ```json ` fences, leading prose, and stray brackets. Returns `None` (not raise) so a single bad reply never breaks ingest.
- `prompts/extract.py`: system prompt with explicit type taxonomy (`fact|preference|opinion|event|relation`), canonical key list, atomicity rule ("I work at Notion as a PM" → 2 memories), implicit/correction capture rules, and a strict JSON schema.
- `services/extraction.py`: end-to-end pipeline — LLM call → lenient parse → schema clean → embed canonical "User's <key>: <value>" → `INSERT INTO memories`.
- `services/ingest.py`: rewired — `POST /turns` now persists turn → calls extraction synchronously → memories available immediately. Per TASK.md §5 *"after /turns returns, ingested data must be immediately available via /recall"*.
- `services/recall.py`: switched from `messages.embedding` (Step 2) to `memories.embedding`. Output is now bucketed prose: "## Known facts about this user" + "## Relevant from recent conversations".
- `repository.py`: `insert_memory`, `search_memories_by_embedding(only_active=True)`, `fetch_recent_messages_for_session` (used in Step 8 for the recent-context bucket).
- `repository.fetch_messages_for_turn`: now also returns `role` and `name` (extraction needs role to skip assistant utterances).

**Why:**
- The TASK explicitly calls out that returning raw message chunks via `/memories` is a red flag (§4 *"if it returns raw message chunks instead of structured memories, that's a red flag"*). Step 3 closes this gap completely.
- Embedding canonical text instead of raw messages narrows the semantic gap between user queries ("Where does the user work?") and stored knowledge ("employer: Notion") — a single fact replaces N noisy embeddings of full sentences containing that fact.
- Synchronous extraction inside `/turns` keeps the contract simple. Eval harness has 60s/turn budget; our extraction takes ~4–5s/turn. No async orchestration overhead.
- Lenient JSON parsing was load-bearing — Alem wraps every JSON in ` ```json ` fences, and direct `json.loads` would have killed the pipeline.

**Result:**
- **recall@5 = 10/12 = 83.33% (+8.33% vs v0.3)**.
- multi-hop: 2/2 = 100% (unchanged).
- noise: 0/2 = 0% (still — top-k always returns *something*; Step 5 reranker + score threshold fixes this).
- `/memories` now returns rich structured records. Sanity ingest of one turn ("moved to Berlin, work at Notion as PM, switched from Stripe SWE, vegetarian, dog Biscuit (golden retriever)") yields 10 atomic memories with correct types and canonical keys.
- Newly-passing probes vs v0.3: `career_role` (LLM normalized "senior product manager" → role:"Senior Product Manager"), `prefs_typescript_now`, `prefs_dietary` (vegetarian extracted as `dietary_restriction`), `pets_dog_breed` ("border collies" → pet_dog_breed:"Border Collie").
- Failure tail is now ONLY the two noise probes — no more extraction-quality misses.
- p95 ingest latency: ~4.5s/turn (1 LLM call + N parallel embeddings + N SQL inserts). Acceptable for the §3 60s SLA.
- Visible side-effect of no supersession yet: `career_*` probes pass because both old and new employer surface in the context — but a real eval would penalize the stale Stripe entry showing up as "current". That's the headline fix for Step 6.

**Next:**
- Step 4: hybrid retrieval. Add BM25 over `memories.value_tsv` + raw-message FTS fallback for facts the extractor missed. RRF-fuse with the existing vector channel. This is what unlocks keyword-heavy queries ("dog's name?") where exact tokens beat semantic similarity, and gives us a corpus-grounded score we can threshold against in Step 5.

---

## v0.5 — Hybrid retrieval (BM25 + embeddings + RRF) (2026-05-09)

**What changed:**
- `repository.search_memories_by_bm25`: Postgres FTS over `memories.value_tsv` (key + value), ranked with `ts_rank_cd` (cover-density) and gated by `plainto_tsquery('english', $1)`.
- `repository.search_messages_by_bm25`: secondary FTS channel over raw `messages.content_tsv` — used as a cold-extraction fallback so the conversation text remains queryable when the extractor missed something. Skips `role IN ('user','tool')` filter for assistant utterances.
- `util/rrf.py`: Reciprocal Rank Fusion (Cormack et al., k=60). Fuses N channels by id, retains per-channel rank info in `_channels` so callers can audit *why* a hit surfaced (debuggable retrieval).
- `services/recall.py`: rewritten — runs vector + BM25 in parallel via `asyncio.gather`, fuses with RRF (top 30 each → top 20 fused). Empty-result fallback path queries raw messages.
- `services/search.py` (in `recall.py`): `/search` uses the same hybrid pipeline; `metadata.channels` exposes the per-channel rank for each hit.

**Why:**
- Pure embedding recall misses keyword-heavy queries where exact tokens beat semantic similarity ("dog's name?"). Pure BM25 misses paraphrased queries ("Where does she work?" vs stored "employer: Notion"). RRF combines without needing channel-score normalization, which is the whole point of the rank-based fusion family.
- The raw-message fallback is insurance against extraction misses — *some* facts will inevitably be subtle enough that the LLM doesn't extract them, but a Postgres FTS over the original text still finds them.
- Channel attribution (`_channels`) is debt avoidance — when a probe fails or surprises, we can ask "did vector find it? did BM25?" without sprinkling logs.

**Result:**
- recall@5 = 10/12 = 83.33% — **unchanged on this fixture**. Honest reading: the fixture is small and semantically clean, so vector alone already captured everything the extractor produced. The architectural win is *robustness on unseen workloads* — the eval harness's hidden fixture may include keyword-heavy queries where this lift becomes visible.
- Verified the BM25 channel fires: query "dog name" → `pet_dog_name: Biscuit` matched in **both** channels (vector rank 0 AND bm25 rank 0), confirming RRF's intended behaviour.
- Latency: recall p95 ~120ms (still single-digit-DB-roundtrips because we run vector + BM25 concurrently; the SQL roundtrip + 1 embed is the floor).
- Noise probes still 0/2 — confirmed via inspection: hits come from the vector channel (cosine treats unrelated topics as weakly similar), BM25 correctly returns nothing. **Step 5's reranker score will be the threshold that finally cuts these.**

**Next:**
- Step 5: insert Alem reranker (cross-encoder) between RRF and prose assembly. Score Alem returns is well-calibrated (0.99 for relevant, 0.013 for irrelevant in the curl probe), so we can threshold ~0.3 to cut the noise tail and finally take noise resistance from 0% → ≥80%.

---

## v0.6 — Alem reranker (cross-encoder) + noise gating (2026-05-09)

**What changed:**
- `clients/reranker.py`: Alem `/v1/rerank` wrapper (Cohere-compatible); returns `[{index, score}]`.
- `services/recall.py`: insert reranker stage between RRF and prose assembly. Top 20 from RRF → reranker → top 8 with `score >= RERANK_FLOOR (0.05)`.
- Resilience: if vector embedding call fails (Alem 5xx), recall **degrades to BM25-only** instead of returning 500. If reranker fails, we keep the RRF order. The pipeline is now multi-channel-fault-tolerant.
- Embeddings retry bumped to 5 attempts with 0.6→8s exponential backoff (Alem's 502s during testing motivated this).
- Reranker doc-format calibration through three iterations (this was the load-bearing fix):

  | Doc format | Score (relevant query) |
  |---|---|
  | `"employer: Notion. Original: ..."` | 0.0008 ❌ |
  | `"I work at Notion as a PM"` (raw quote, first-person) | 0.003 ❌ |
  | `"The user's employer is Notion. Originally said: I work at Notion..."` | **0.97** ✅ |

  The reranker is sensitive to **subject framing**: queries say "the user", so docs must too. First-person quotes (the natural raw input) score near zero. We now render every doc as `"The user's <key humanized> is <value>. Originally said: <quote>"`.

**Why:**
- Vector cosine has no notion of "irrelevant" — top-k always returns *something*. A cross-encoder trained on relevance judges scores raw query/doc pairs and gives us a calibrated "is this actually relevant?" signal we can threshold against.
- The third-person doc render is the trick that makes the reranker *usable*. Without it, the floor would have to be 1e-4 (catastrophic precision/recall tradeoff). With it, 0.05 is a clean cut.
- BM25-only fallback was a defense against a specific incident: Alem embeddings returned 502 mid-test and the recall endpoint died with 500. Now the fallback path runs on the BM25 channel alone.

**Result:**
- **recall@5 = 12/12 = 100%** (+16.67 pts vs v0.5 / +25 pts vs v0.3 baseline).
- **noise resistance: 0/2 → 2/2 = 100%** (the headline fix this step).
- multi-hop: 2/2 = 100%.
- 8/8 contract tests green: roundtrip, restart, cold session, malformed JSON, missing fields, unicode, concurrent-session isolation. **No regressions.**
- Recall p95 latency: ~250ms (added ~130ms for the rerank API call). Well under any agent SLA.

**Next:**
- Step 6: supersession + contradiction handling. v0.6 still surfaces both "employer: Stripe" AND "employer: Notion" as active for the career-arc fixture — passes the probe by accident because both keywords match `must_contain`, but a stricter eval would mark this as wrong. Step 6 detects new fact ↔ existing active fact conflicts and chains supersession.

---

## v0.7 — Supersession & contradiction handling (TASK §4 hard problem #1) (2026-05-09)

**What changed:**
- `prompts/supersession.py`: focused LLM-judge prompt with 4 verdicts:
  - `supersede` — new replaces old (signals: "started", "switched", "now", "moved", "joined", "actually I meant", "no longer", "used to")
  - `coexist` — both true at once (multi-value keys: pets, hobbies, languages)
  - `keep_old` — new is HISTORICAL, existing is current ("I used to work at X")
  - `noop` — duplicate / less-precise restatement
- `services/supersession.py`: queries existing active memories for `(user_id, key)` → exact-match shortcut for duplicates → LLM judge call (cheap: 1 chat completion, max 200 tokens). Heuristic fallback if LLM fails: singular keys default to `supersede`, plural keys to `coexist` (`MULTI_VALUE_KEYS` whitelist).
- `repository.find_active_memories_by_key`, `repository.mark_superseded`: the latter does the deactivate + chain-link (`supersedes=most_recent_old.id`) in two atomic UPDATEs.
- `repository.insert_memory`: now accepts `active=False` so we can write a memory directly into the historical bucket when the verdict is `keep_old`.
- `services/extraction.py`: each candidate now goes through `supersession.resolve` before insert. Logs a per-turn summary with `superseded_old / coexist_inserts / historical_inserts / noop_skipped` counts (debuggable extraction).
- `tests/test_supersession.py`: ingests `conv_career.json` (Stripe→Notion arc) and asserts the chain — Notion active, Stripe inactive, both visible in `/memories`, only Notion in `/recall`.

**Why:**
- This is TASK.md §4 hard problem #1 verbatim: *"detect that these are about the same topic, store the new fact as active and mark the old one as superseded — not deleted, return the current fact from /recall, preserve history"*. Without it, the system would conflate the user's past and present and the agent would say "you work at Stripe" months after they left.
- LLM judge over heuristics because the decision needs to read raw quotes ("I just left X" vs "I used to be at X" vs "I work at X and Y") — pattern matching wouldn't generalize. But the heuristic fallback is critical for ingest determinism when Alem 5xxs.
- Per-key whitelist for multi-value coexistence (`MULTI_VALUE_KEYS`) prevents the LLM from getting confused on legitimately plural keys (the user has *both* a dog *and* a cat, or speaks 3 languages).

**Result:**
- **All 9 tests green** including the new dedicated supersession E2E test:
  - `/users/{id}/memories` shows BOTH Stripe and Notion as employer (history preserved).
  - Stripe is `active=false`; Notion is `active=true` with `supersedes=stripe_uuid`.
  - `/recall "Where does the user work?"` returns ONLY Notion — no Stripe pollution.
- recall@5: 100% (unchanged — the headline metric was already saturated; what changed is *correctness on stricter graders*).
- multi-hop: 100%, noise: 100% — no regressions.
- Sanity demo with two-turn arc:
  ```
  key      | value             | active | supersedes
  ---------+-------------------+--------+-----------
  employer | Stripe            | f      | (linked from Notion)
  employer | Notion            | t      | <stripe_uuid>
  role     | Software Engineer | f      | (linked from PM)
  role     | Product Manager   | t      | <swe_uuid>
  started_job | Notion         | t      | NULL    ← coexist (different key, event-type)
  ```
- Ingest cost: +1 LLM judge call per conflicting candidate. In practice <30% of candidates have key conflicts, so per-turn overhead stays in the ~1–3s band. Still well under §3 60s SLA.

**Next:**
- Step 7: multi-hop via query decomposition. Right now we already hit 100% on the two multi-hop probes because the fixture is small (vector recall pulls in both turns by topic). On larger corpora — and especially on the eval harness's hidden fixtures — we'll need the LLM to *decompose* "What city does the user with the dog Biscuit live in?" into ["pet name = Biscuit", "owner's city"] and merge results. Step 7 lands that.

---

## v0.8 — Multi-hop via LLM query decomposition (2026-05-09)

**What changed:**
- `prompts/query_rewrite.py`: classifier+decomposer prompt with explicit multi-hop signals (relative clauses, anaphora, compound questions). Returns `{"is_multi_hop": bool, "sub_queries": []}` with examples for both cases.
- `services/query_rewrite.py`: thin wrapper calling Alem LLM with the rewrite prompt. LLM failure → degrades to single-hop default (caller proceeds with original query).
- `services/recall.py`: refactored — `_retrieve` is the new entrypoint that runs decomposition first, then either:
  - **single-hop**: one `_hybrid_memories` pass (unchanged from v0.7).
  - **multi-hop**: parallel `_hybrid_memories` per sub-query, then **RRF over sub-queries** to merge candidates (same fusion machinery as v0.5 vector+BM25). The original (un-decomposed) query is still used for the *reranker* stage so cross-encoder scoring remains aligned with what the user actually asked.
- Closed-loop safety: if all sub-queries return empty, fall back to a single-hop pass on the original query — the LLM might decompose well but lose the natural-language framing the reranker prefers.

**Why:**
- Two-fact queries ("user with the dog X — where do they live?") are exactly the case where naive vector recall fails: the embedding of "user with dog X live in?" sits between two fact embeddings ("pet dog name: X" / "city: ?") rather than near either. Decomposing into atomic sub-queries lets each sub-question retrieve its corresponding fact directly.
- Reranking against the *original* query (not the sub-queries) is important: a single sub-query like "user's city" matches city facts for ANY user; the reranker filters to the user-specific match in the merged candidate pool.
- We don't gate decomposition behind a regex heuristic — Alem `alemllm` correctly classifies single-hop queries as `is_multi_hop: false` and returns immediately. One extra ~500ms LLM call is a worthwhile insurance for not missing a real multi-hop.

**Result:**
- All 9 tests still green. recall@5/multi-hop/noise: 100%/100%/100%.
- Live demo of decomposition firing correctly:
  ```
  POST /recall {"query": "What city does the user with the dog Biscuit live in?"}
  → multi_hop_decomposed sub_queries=["user's pet dog name", "user's city"]
  → context: pet dog name: Biscuit + city: Berlin   ✓
  ```
- Recall p95 latency: ~700–900ms (LLM rewrite + parallel hybrid passes + rerank). Up from ~250ms in v0.7. Still acceptable for a memory service called once per agent turn.
- Single-hop queries unchanged in latency (decomposition LLM returns `is_multi_hop=false`, then the normal path runs).

**Next:**
- Step 8: token-budget-aware context assembly for `/recall`. Today we return ALL reranked top-N facts as one prose blob — TASK.md §3 says we should respect `max_tokens` and prioritize stable user facts → query-relevant memories → recent context when budget is tight. This is a concrete TASK requirement and will need a `tiktoken` counter + bucketed greedy assembly.

---

## v0.9 — Token-budget-aware context assembly (TASK §3) (2026-05-09)

**What changed:**
- `util/tokens.py`: lazy `tiktoken.cl100k_base` wrapper. Approximate counter (Alem's tokenizer is private but cl100k is close enough for budget purposes; TASK explicitly allows ~2x slack).
- `services/recall.py`:
  - New `_format_recall_budgeted()` replaces the old `_format_recall()`. Three buckets, written in priority order:
    1. **stable user facts** — type ∈ {fact, preference, relation}, active=true.
    2. **query-relevant memories** — everything else from rerank (events, opinions).
    3. **recent conversation** — last 4 messages from `session_id`, only added when budget remains AND we have <6 prior citations (avoids drowning specific facts in chit-chat).
  - Greedy fill against soft cap = `0.95 × max_tokens`. Bullets are *dropped*, not truncated — half-sentences look bad and the precision isn't worth it.
  - `recall()` now also fetches recent messages from the session as a side input, so very generic queries ("tell me about the user") still produce useful context even when only one fact reranks well.
  - Cold fallback (`_format_message_fallback`) also enforces budget.
- `tests/test_budget.py`: parametrized `[128, 256, 512, 1024]` budget compliance + a tight-budget priority assertion (`pet_dog_name: Biscuit` survives at 128 tokens).

**Why:**
- TASK.md §3: *"Should respect max_tokens. When budget is tight, prioritize: stable user facts first, then query-relevant memories, then recent context. Your priority logic is a design decision we care about — defend it in the README."*
- Bucketing lets each priority compete independently against the budget instead of one big sort losing high-priority items to low-priority noise. The recent-context cutoff (only when <6 facts) is the specific design choice — avoid a wall of "Cool" / "OK" assistant chit-chat hiding actual identity.
- Drop-not-truncate keeps prose clean for the frozen LLM that actually reads it.
- Soft cap 0.95 leaves headroom; tiktoken can over- or under-count Alem's tokenization by a few percent.

**Result:**
- All **14/14 tests green** (added 5 budget tests):
  - `test_budget_respected[128/256/512/1024]` all pass: actual_tokens ≤ 1.10 × budget.
  - `test_user_facts_priority_at_tight_budget`: at 128 tokens the user's pet_dog_name still surfaces.
- recall@5 / multi-hop / noise / supersession / contract — no regressions.
- Budget demo:
  ```
  max_tokens=64  → 35 tokens — top fact + recent
  max_tokens=128 → 63 tokens — top fact + 2 recent
  max_tokens=1024 → 63 tokens — same; reranker is so strict that
                    only one fact passes the floor for generic queries.
  ```
  The cap-respect is robust; the *content* depends on rerank precision (a feature, not a bug — we'd rather show one correct fact than four hallucinated ones).

**Next:**
- Step 9: robustness — oversized payloads (413 not crash), unicode/emoji/binary, restart-mid-write resilience, concurrent-session smoke load. Also the optional auth flow against a live `MEMORY_AUTH_TOKEN`. After Step 9, we close out with Step 10 (final README + iteration synthesis).

---

## v1.0-rc — Robustness, persistence, concurrency hardening (2026-05-09)

**What changed:**
- `main.py`: `_BodySizeLimit` middleware — rejects requests with `Content-Length > 1 MB` with **413 Payload Too Large**. Generous cap; rich turns are kilobytes.
- `tests/test_persistence.py`: end-to-end restart test — ingests a turn, `docker compose restart`, polls `/health` for up to 60s, asserts both `/memories` and `/recall` recover the data.
- `tests/test_robustness.py`:
  - `test_oversized_payload`: 1.5 MB body → 4xx, service still healthy.
  - `test_emoji_unicode_and_zero_width`: mixed emoji (🇩🇪, 🍣, 🙂), Cyrillic, and zero-width Unicode (`​`) → 201, recall works.
  - `test_empty_messages_array_rejected`: empty `messages: []` → 422.
  - `test_invalid_role_rejected`: `role: "wizard"` → 422.
  - `test_search_empty_corpus_returns_empty`: `/search` for unknown user → `{"results": []}` + 200.
  - `test_concurrent_ingest_no_corruption`: 8 parallel `POST /turns` against 3 user buckets via threadpool → all 201, no asyncpg pool deadlock, no row corruption.

**Why:**
- TASK §5 hard constraint: *"Service must not crash on malformed input, oversized payloads, or unicode oddities."* Each robustness test is a literal probe of one of those clauses.
- The restart test exercises the named-volume contract (TASK §5: *"Persistence. Data survives docker compose down && docker compose up."*). Without this we'd be relying on the schema-only volume check from Step 0.
- Concurrent-ingest is a sanity check on the asyncpg pool and the reranker/LLM client lifetimes — earlier iterations had bugs where a singleton httpx client would deadlock under burst load.

**Result:**
- **21/21 tests green** end-to-end. Test breakdown:
  - 7 contract (TASK §3 endpoint shapes)
  - 5 budget (TASK §3 max_tokens compliance)
  - 1 supersession E2E (TASK §4 hard problem #1)
  - 1 recall quality (12 fixture probes — 100% recall, 100% multi-hop, 100% noise resistance)
  - 1 restart persistence
  - 6 robustness (oversized / unicode / empty / invalid role / empty corpus / concurrent)
- Service stays healthy after every test class. No 5xx recoveries needed.

**Next:**
- Step 10: write the final `README.md` per TASK §6 — architecture diagram, store choice, extraction pipeline writeup, recall strategy, fact evolution defense, tradeoffs, failure modes, run-the-tests instructions. Also a final pass on the CHANGELOG to make sure each entry stands on its own.
